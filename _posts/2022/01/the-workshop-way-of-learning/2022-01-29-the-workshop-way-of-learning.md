description: "The definition of learning that I always use"
---

Every single one of the folks working at tech knows that we will never stop learning. So, as a group, it’s important to understand what learning really is.

The best definition I found was from Earl C. Kelley:

> *“We have not succeeded in answering all our problems. The answers we have found only serve to raise a whole set of new questions. In some ways, we feel we are as confused as ever, but we believe we are confused on a higher level and about more important things.”
> — The Workshop Way of Learning (1951)*
