Recently, I was revisiting a blog post from around 2014 about hacker culture and the art of asking <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"><em>smart questions</em></a> in technical open forums. I’ve taken the ideas from that post and applied them to a wider range of situations. You should read this guide to improve your question skills and increase your chances of receiving a satisfactory answer.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-ask">Before You Ask</h2>

<p>In general, the kind of answers you get to your questions depends as much on the way you ask them as on the difficulty of developing the answer.</p>

<p>Real creators like hard problems and good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we didn’t, we wouldn’t be here. When you present us with an engaging question, we appreciate it; well-crafted questions are a precious gift.  They help us refine our understanding and often bring to light issues we might otherwise overlook. Among problem solvers, “Good question!” is a sincere compliment.</p>

<p>Despite this, we often have a reputation for responding to simple questions with what may appear as hostility or arrogance. This can sometimes come across as rudeness towards newcomers and those who are less knowledgeable. Yet, the reality is different.</p>

<p>What we are, is hostile to people who seem unwilling to invest the effort in thinking or conducting their own homework before asking questions.  People like that are time sinks — they take without giving back, and they waste time we could have spent on another question more interesting and another person more worthy of an answer.</p>

<p>Still, our style of answering questions is tuned for people who <em>do</em> take an active interest in problem-solving and are willing to be active participants in the process.  That’s not going to change.  Nor should it; if it did, we would become less effective at the things we do best.</p>

<p>If you find our attitude condescending or arrogant, check your assumptions.  We don’t expect you to defer to us— in fact, most of us would love to engage with you as equals and welcome you into our culture if you put in the effort required to make that possible. However, it’s not efficient for us to try to help those who are not willing to help themselves.</p>

<p>Therefore, while competence isn’t a prerequisite for receiving attention from us, demonstrating the attitude that leads to competence—being thoughtful, observant, and willing to actively collaborate on finding solutions—is essential.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-ask">How to Ask</h2>

<p>Proficient creators blow off questions that are improperly targeted to try to protect their communications channels from being drowned in irrelevance.  They are already receiving more than their fair share of mistargeted messages. Also, reaching out to someone you aren’t familiar with is risky at best. For instance, don’t assume that the founder of raising startup wants to be your free consultant.  If you want a responsive answer, approach your question like someone who possesses intelligence, confidence, and some clues but simply needs assistance with a specific problem.</p>

<p>Before asking a question, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe the symptoms of your problem.</li>
  <li>Describe the context in which it occurs.</li>
  <li>Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.</li>
  <li>Try to find an answer by yourself.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you ask your question, show that you’ve taken these initial steps. This will help establish that you’re not being a lazy sponge and wasting people’s time. Even better, display what you’ve <em>learned</em> from doing those things. We appreciate answering questions for people who have demonstrated they can learn from the answers. Making it clear that you are able and willing to participate in developing a solution is a very good start.</p>

<p>Take your time. Complex problems take time. Pause, think, and give the problem some thought before approaching experts. Trust us, we will be able to tell from your questions how much reading and thinking you did, and will be more willing to help if you come prepared. Don’t fire your whole arsenal of questions because your initial search didn’t yield results, or provided too many.</p>

<p>Prepare your question. Think it through.  Hasty-sounding questions get hasty answers, or none at all. The more you demonstrate that you’ve put genuine thought and effort into solving the problem before seeking help, the more likely you are to actually, get help.</p>

<h2 id="when-you-ask">When You Ask</h2>

<p>Avoid making optimistic guesses about whether your question will be well-received. If you’re unsure, send it elsewhere, or refrain from sending it at all. Never assume you are <em>entitled</em> to an answer. You aren’t. You will earn an answer, if you earn it, by asking an engaging and thought-provoking question — one that adds value to the community rather than demanding knowledge from others.</p>

<p>In general, questions to a well-selected public are more likely to get useful responses than equal questions to a private individual.  There are several reasons for this. One is the larger pool of potential respondents.  Another is the size of the audience; creators would rather answer questions that educate many people than those that benefit only a few.</p>

<h3 id="make-it-easy-to-reply"><strong>Make it easy to reply</strong></h3>

<h4 id="use-specific-subject-headers"><strong>Use specific subject headers</strong></h4>

<p>Make your subject line accurately reflect your question. One good convention for subject headers is <em>“object</em>—<em>deviation”,</em> where “object” specifies what is having a problem, and the “deviation” describes the deviation from expected behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Stupid:</strong> “Help me find a co-founder”</p>

<p><strong>Smart:</strong> “Tech startup co-founder search - I need guidance”</p>

<p><strong>Smarter:</strong> “Tech startup co-founder search - I need strategies for networking experienced ed-tech founders”</p>

<h4 id="volume-is-not-precision"><strong>Volume is not precision</strong></h4>

<p>I’ve found by experience that people who are sloppy writers are also sloppy at thinking. Answering questions from careless thinkers is not rewarding; we’d rather spend our time elsewhere. Thus, expressing your question clearly is important. If you can’t be bothered to do that, we can’t be bothered to pay attention.</p>

<p>Spend the extra effort to polish your language. It doesn’t have to be formal—in fact, we value informal humorous language used with precision. But it has to <em>be</em> precise; there has to be some sign that you’re thinking and paying attention. This end isn’t served by dumping your question with a massive amount of data. If you have a large, complex problem, aim to trim it as small as possible. This is useful for at least two reasons.  First, simplifying the question makes it more likely you’ll get a useful answer.  Second, during the process of refining your problem, you may discover a solution or workaround yourself</p>

<h4 id="groveling-is-not-a-substitute-for-doing-your-homework"><strong>Groveling is not a substitute for doing your homework</strong></h4>

<p>Some people who get that they shouldn’t behave rudely, demanding an answer, retreat to the opposite extreme of groveling.  “I know I’m just a newbie, but…”.  This is distracting and unhelpful.  It’s especially annoying when it’s coupled with vagueness about the actual problem.</p>

<p>Don’t waste your time, or ours, on politics. Instead, present the background facts and your question as clearly as you can.  That is a better way to position yourself than by groveling.</p>

<h4 id="describe-the-problems-symptoms-not-your-guesses"><strong>Describe the problem’s symptoms, not your guesses</strong></h4>

<p>Often, people who need help have a high-level goal in mind and get stuck on what they think is one path toward the goal. They come for help with the step, but don’t realize that the path is wrong.  It can take substantial effort to get past this. See the <a href="https://xyproblem.info/"><em>XY problem</em></a>. If you are trying to find out how to do something, begin by describing the goal.  Only then describe the particular step towards it that you are blocked on.</p>

<p>Also, it’s not useful to tell what you think is causing your problem. If you were confident about your diagnostic, would you be consulting others for help? So, make sure you’re telling the raw symptoms of what goes wrong, rather than your interpretations. Let them do the interpretation and diagnosis. If you feel it’s important to state your guess, label it as such and describe why that answer isn’t working for you.</p>

<p><strong>Stupid:</strong> How do I use this specific library to generate PDFs from my data in Python?</p>

<p><strong>Smart:</strong> I want to create PDF documents from data in Python, and I’m currently exploring different libraries to achieve this. While I’ve been looking into using Library X, I’m open to other suggestions or approaches that might be more suitable for this task.</p>

<h4 id="be-explicit-about-your-question"><strong>Be explicit about your question</strong></h4>

<p>Open-ended questions tend to be perceived as open-ended time sinks. Those people most likely to be able to give you a useful answer are also the busiest people (if only because they take on the most work themselves). People like that are allergic to open-ended time sinks, thus they tend to be allergic to open-ended questions.</p>

<p>You are more likely to get a useful response if you are explicit about what you want respondents to do. This will focus their effort and implicitly put an upper bound on the time and energy a respondent must allocate to helping you. This is good.</p>

<p>To understand the world the experts live in, think of expertise as an abundant resource and time to respond as a scarce one. The less of a time commitment you implicitly ask for, the more likely you are to get an answer from someone really good and really busy. So it is useful to frame your question to minimize the time commitment required for an expert to field it — but this is often not the same thing as simplifying the question.</p>

<h4 id="prune-pointless-queries"><strong>Prune pointless queries</strong></h4>

<p>Resist the temptation to close your request for help with null questions like “Can anyone help me?” or “Is there an answer?”. First, if you’ve written your problem description halfway, such tacked-on questions are at best superfluous.  Second, because they are superfluous, creators find them annoying.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-interpret-answers"><strong>How To Interpret Answers</strong></h3>

<h4 id="if-you-dont-understand-the-answer">If you don’t understand the answer</h4>

<p>Much of what looks like rudeness in creators’ circles is not intended to give offense.  Rather, it’s the product of the direct, cut-through-the-bullshit communications style that is natural to people who are more concerned about solving problems than making others feel warm and fuzzy. So, if you don’t understand the answer, do not immediately bounce back a demand for clarification. Use the same tools that you used to try and answer your original question to understand the answer.  Then, if you still need to ask for clarification, exhibit what you have learned.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-cant-get-an-answer">If You Can’t Get An Answer</h4>

<p>If you can’t get an answer, please don’t take it personally that we don’t feel we can help you. Sometimes we may not know the answer.  No response is not the same as being ignored, though it’s hard to spot the difference from the outside. In general, re-posting your question is a bad idea.  This will be seen as annoying.  Have patience. Remember that the busy expert with your answer is solving more important problems, or it may be that your question wasn’t well-formed, to begin with.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-answer-questions">How To Answer Questions</h3>

<p><em>Be gentle.</em> Problem-related stress can make people seem rude or stupid even when they’re not.</p>

<p><em>If you don’t know for sure, say so!</em> A wrong but authoritative-sounding answer is worse than none at all.  Don’t point anyone down a wrong path because it’s fun to sound like an expert.  Be humble and honest; set a good example.</p>

<p><em>If you can’t help, don’t hinder.</em> Don’t make jokes about initiatives that could deviate the querent away from the truth — the poor sap might interpret these as instructions.</p>

<p><em>Ask probing questions to elicit more details.</em> If you’re good at this, the querent will learn something — and so might you.  Try to turn the bad question into a good one; remember we were all newbies once. Reframe the question.</p>

<p><em>If you’re going to answer the question, give good value.</em> Don’t suggest kludgy workarounds when somebody is using the wrong approach.  Suggest good frameworks.</p>

<p><em>Help your community learn from the question.</em> When you field a good question, ask yourself “What do I need to change so that nobody has to answer this again?”. One simple answer to this is to write a blog post about it, like this one!</p>

<p><em>Demonstrate your research skills rather than writing as though you pulled the answer out of your butt.</em> Answering one good question is like feeding a hungry person one meal, but teaching them research skills by example is showing them how to grow food for a lifetime.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lucas Vittor</name><email>lvvittor@gmail.com</email></author><category term="english" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As always, my writing is influenced by my learning.

<h2 id="an-eli5-introduction-to-ml-models">An ELI5 introduction to ML models</h2>

<p>Machine learning (ML) models can seem overwhelming, but they can be broken down into four main parts: input, model type, model parameters, and output.</p>

<p><img src="ml-artifacts.png" alt="ML artifacts" /></p>

<p>The input data is preprocessed into a format suitable for the model, and initial parameters are set up (depending on the model used), including layers, weights, biases, and learning rates. The model then learns to extract relevant features between them, with the output serving as input for the next layer.</p>

<h2 id="issues-with-the-state-of-the-art-of-ml">Issues with the state of the art of ML</h2>

<h3 id="the-black-box-trust-issue-with-ml">The black-box trust issue with ML</h3>

<p>As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML become more integrated into our daily lives, issues of trust are becoming increasingly critical. ML models’ lack of transparency and black-box algorithms are two main reasons behind trust issues, making it difficult to trust ML inferences.</p>

<p><img src="meme-1.png" alt="xkcd meme" /></p>

<h3 id="the-privacy-issue-with-ml">The privacy issue with ML</h3>

<p>With lightweight ML frameworks and interoperable formats, such as ONNX, we can now perform ML inference on edge devices such as mobile phones or IOT devices without sending the (potentially sensitive) input to centralized servers.  However, several privacy-related challenges persist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is often a desire to hide the input and/or the model parameters from the public view.
    <ul>
      <li>The input data provided to ML models may include personal and confidential information, such as financial data, biometric records, or private multimedia.</li>
      <li>The model parameters themselves may contain sensitive details, such as biometric authentication parameters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Simultaneously, downstream entities that rely on the outputs of ML models, such as on-chain smart contracts, must ensure the veracity of the input’s processing by the ML model, validating the correctness of the claimed output.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heuristic optimization</strong>
Heuristic optimization is an approach to problem-solving that leverages rules of thumb, commonly referred to as “heuristics,” to find effective solutions for complex problems that are challenging to solve using conventional optimization methods. Instead of aiming for the globally optimal solution, heuristic optimization methods strive to identify a satisfactory or “good enough” solution within a reasonable time frame. The selection of an appropriate solution is influenced by the problem’s significance within the overall system and the inherent difficulty involved in its optimization.</p>

<p><strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption ML (FHE-ML)</strong>
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) in the context of machine learning (ML) empowers developers to perform operations on encrypted data. When decrypted, the output of these operations corresponds to the result of applying the operations on the original, unencrypted input. FHE-ML provides a means to evaluate ML models in a privacy-preserving manner, ensuring full data privacy. It should be noted, however, that unlike Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs), FHE-ML does not offer a cryptographic means to verify the correctness of the computations being performed.</p>

<p><strong>ZK proofs vs. Validity proofs</strong>
In the industry, the terms “ZK proofs” and “validity proofs” are sometimes used interchangeably, as validity proofs represent a specific subset of ZK proofs where no parts of the computation or its results are concealed. Within the context of zkML, current applications predominantly leverage the validity proof aspect of ZK proofs.</p>

<p><strong>Validity ML</strong>
Validity ML, exemplified by the employment of SNARKs (Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge) and STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge), refers to the practice of constructing proofs for ML models where all computations are publicly observable by the verifier. Any verifier can subsequently authenticate the computational correctness of the ML models, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness.</p>

<p><strong>zkML</strong> 
In contrast to validity ML, zkML employs ZK proofs to establish the computational correctness of ML models while concealing the underlying computations from the verifier, utilizing the zero-knowledge property. By leveraging ZK proofs, the prover can furnish evidence for the accuracy of the ML models without divulging any further information, thus providing a powerful tool for preserving privacy and confidentiality.</p>

<h3 id="uses-cases-of-zkml">Uses cases of zkML</h3>

<p><strong>Transparency in MLaaS</strong></p>

<p>In MLaaS, validating the authenticity and integrity of models provided by different service providers poses a challenge due to the black-box nature of APIs. To address this, incorporating validity proofs becomes crucial. Providing validity proofs attached to an ML model API would be useful to provide transparency to the user as they can verify which model they are using.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy-Preserving Medical Diagnostics</strong></p>

<p>Medical diagnostics on private patient data get fed into the model and the sensitive inference (e.g., cancer test result) gets sent to the patient.</p>

<p><strong>Confidential Financial Data Analysis</strong></p>

<p>zkML offers a viable solution by allowing financial institutions to collaborate on analyzing data without sharing the raw information. This enables multiple parties to collectively train ML models while maintaining data privacy, thereby enhancing fraud detection capabilities and risk management practices.</p>

<p><strong>Secure Federated Learning</strong></p>

<p>Federated Learning, a collaborative approach that trains ML models across multiple decentralized devices or institutions, necessitates robust privacy protection. ZKML can play a pivotal role in this context by ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the local devices.</p>

Whenever I talk about a consulting startup, a software factory, or any heavy business-to-business company to someone I usually spend quite a time explaining the whys and wherefores of managing this kind of business. It’s not easy, though.</p>

<p>One important key point to understand is that B2B companies are (usually) easy to start. You just need someone who is willing to pay money for your work, that’s it. However, after some time you have started, is often the case that’s very hard to get better clients (the ones who pay more and argue less about your decisions).</p>

<p>The good part of this <em>art</em> of having better clients, more free time for R&amp;D, and less noise is that we, as an industry, have developed a road-map to move early B2B companies from looking for easy clients to working on hyper-specialized problems for the best clients.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll explain to you some of the most important shifts your company needs to do to achieve what is called “<em>The art of B2B differentiation“.</em></p>

<h2 id="specialization-is-key">Specialization is key</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, specialization is a way to stand out from the crowd when seeking new clients. When we reduce the alternatives to hiring our company, we shift the power balance away from the client and towards us. Our experience, expertise, and the very way in which we deliver the services and products of our business is a key part of connecting with clients, earning their trust and loyalty.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.” – Mark Twain</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>When finding specialization, usually the hardest part is not finding a niche but rather being seen as an expert in the niche we work. A niche (ironically) doesn’t have to be tiny, it just needs to be the area of knowledge our company chooses a focus on and the place where we articulate that focus via a consistent claim of expertise. Our claim of expertise should be a lot narrower than the sum of our capabilities.</p>

<p>Until the day we are called experts, we need to cement our position as leaders in our field through our writing. That’s why great B2B companies have a blog, they are trying to be experts because experts write. Furthermore, having a blog has also another benefit than <a href="https://www.lucasvittor.com/how-great-founders-do-more-with-less/#customers-were-strangers-before">transforming strangers into customers</a>: it attracts curious people which later will be great hires.</p>

<p>Most important of all, writing about what we do is the fastest way to deepen our knowledge. Writing might not come naturally to us, it might be painful at times, but the rewards are significant and the exercise is mandatory. If we are to be experts we must write.</p>

<p>Another common way of showing what we do and how we do it is to have great use cases of our past work. Having (and not having) a well-shown portfolio of the areas of expertise we claim we have tells a lot about how we work. For clients, a portfolio is the best tool for inspiration. It shows the client what could be. It shows them what others have done.</p>

<p>The next step of specialization is building expertise. So,  we will commit to the idea that continuous learning is mandatory. Expertise is the only valid basis for differentiating ourselves from the competition. Not personality. Not process. Not price. It is expertise and expertise alone that will set us apart in a meaningful way and allow us to deal with our clients and prospects from a position of power.</p>

<p>But, how do we build expertise? Well, maybe I’ll write about this in the future, but in essence, If we have no meaningfully defined processes, then there is not much to train our people on. We need to build a culture of continuous learning by hiring for skill, by developing it through training, by empowering our people to form their own professional development plans that we will approve and fund, by holding them accountable to these plans, and, most importantly, by leading with our own example.</p>

<h2 id="replace-slides-with-conversations">Replace slides with conversations</h2>

<p>Having a conversation with prospective clients is the first crucial step in the pipeline of our incoming projects. When we talk, we listen, empathize and make recommendations with the expertise required to solve complex business problems. However, the essential matter is to respond to the motivation and not necessarily the request.</p>

<p>Understanding the client’s concerns gives us the basic information to start considering about our hopefully long relationship and if they are the proper fit for our company.</p>

<p>When we don’t have these initial conversations with the tough questions up-front, we devalue what should be our most valuable offering and set up the wrong dynamics between the client and us.</p>

<p>When asking the hard questions we need, as a company, to understand that our two main goals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Freedom of execution</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome the client’s input on the strategy and in exchange, we ask him to grant us the freedom to explore various ways of executing it.</p>

<p>The experience says that the client usually has strong ideas and a strong conviction that he is correct, but is constrained by constraints that seem to him to be more immutable than they really are. As the experts we are, we should provide recommendations that are practical and affordable (affordable meaning possible, not cheap).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>There will come a day when we are happy to hear from the client, “Ah, of course!” instead of the previously desired, “Oh, I love it!” —</em> Blair Enns</p>

</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistent routine</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We owe it to our clients to reiterate our claim and point out the gap between what they need and what we do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Little variability in process equals little variability in outcomes. — Some guy at a pre-revenue Startup</em></p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="diagnose-before-prescribe">Diagnose before prescribe</h2>

<p>As experts, instead of seeking clients, we will selectively pursue perfect fits.</p>

<p>The optimal engagement length will differ from client to client, but we must embrace the idea that turnover is healthy, and the subsequent idea that our business development goal is to manage such turnover. If the objection is going to kill the deal, then let’s kill it early.</p>

<p>Furthermore, like any other competent professional, possessing our own formalized diagnostic methods, whether they are proprietary to us or not, goes a long way to our positioning in this matter. From the business perspective, it’s reasonable to expect that if we address similar problems on a regular basis then we would have a formalized way of beginning the engagement.</p>

<p>Generally there are three phases in engagements:</p>

<h3 id="1-diagnose-the-problem-or-opportunity">1. Diagnose the problem or opportunity</h3>

<p>We will agree with the client on the strategy before any development begins.</p>

<h3 id="2-prescribe-a-therapy">2. Prescribe a therapy</h3>

<p>Prior to presenting any therapy, we will review the agreed-upon strategy with the client. We need to give continuous reference to strategy.</p>

<p>When we present options, we will strive to limit them to as few as practical. As experts, we need to present fewer options of better quality. There is an inverse correlation between the number of options we present to the client and the confidence we have in their quality. Moreover, we will recognize our obligation to recommend one over the others.</p>

<h3 id="3-apply-the-therapy">3. Apply the therapy</h3>

<p>We must address that there is a line that separates proving our ability to solve the client’s problem from actually solving his problem. We shall not be lured into crossing over this line before we are paid. The paper is produced only once the agreement has been reached.</p>

<p>These phases should not be confused with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall model</a>, but we should never put ourselves in the position where we are prescribing solutions without first fully diagnosing the client’s challenge. Remember, the goal here is to be profitable, not necessarily creative!</p>

<h2 id="rethink-what-it-means-to-sell">Rethink what it means to sell</h2>

<p>Making things and selling things are the two basic functions in business. For our business to succeed we must succeed at both. Sales cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>Being a great salesperson isn’t about being able to talk up your product. It’s about determining a fit between the buyer’s need and the seller’s supply and then facilitating the next step. Let’s face it, <em>no</em> is the second best answer we can hear.</p>

<p>However, we sell ideas and advice and so how we sell impacts what we are able to deliver. So, a great salesperson needs to know that the psychology of buying is the psychology of changing. Selling, therefore, is change management.</p>

<p>In summary, when we sell we need to focus on two main components:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The sales mission</strong>: position ourselves as the expert in the mind of the prospective client.</li>
  <li><strong>The sales objective</strong>: our objective at each and every interaction in the buying cycle is just to see if there is a fit between the client’s need and our expertise suitable enough to take the next step. That’s it. It is not our objective to convince or persuade. Convincing has no place in selling.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="address-issues-of-money-early">Address Issues of money Early</h2>

<p>The Art of B2B Differentiation is a long-term process. It’s not something you can magically do overnight (the same way that wedding photographers don’t make $10,000 on their first wedding). Just because you’re starting to charge more doesn’t mean you’ll get the cash flow you need to pay your bills.</p>

<p>However, one of our goals is to make money; therefore, we must form the habit of talking about it early and often. Like our competitors, we too will use pricing as a positioning tool; but unlike them, we will strive to demonstrate higher pricing and thus benefit from all its positioning implications.</p>

<p>We will invite the client to tell us that he would prefer to work with a more affordable firm. We will not apologize for charging more; it is fair compensation for the increased value we deliver as experts. It lets us improve our offering by giving us the means to reinvest in ourselves and, most important of all, it almost certainly improves the outcome and the experience for the client. Superior service does not improve profit: profit improves service.</p>

<p>As experts, we will not discount with new clients today for the opportunity to make money tomorrow. This is important, and we need to be aware about some important things when we are talking about money and with prospective clients:</p>

<p><strong>Guarantees</strong></p>

<p>Clients may attempt to negotiate because they are unsure of the value of our services. In these situations, we can consider guarantees as alternatives to discounting. Not guarantees of return on investment – for too many variables remain out of our control. Not guarantees on our entire spectrum of offerings – for they may be used against us late in the engagement.</p>

<p>It is appropriate to guarantee the first phase – diagnosis and prescription – of a phased engagement in order to reassure the client of the value of moving forward with us. There is far less risk in this guarantee than there is in pitching free ideas and hoping to get paid.</p>

<p><strong>Terms</strong></p>

<p>Clients may see the value of our offering but attempt to negotiate based on their inability to pay. In these situations, before we discount we should consider offering favorable terms that let the client pay over time.</p>

<p><strong>We Leave it to Last</strong></p>

<p>First, we will ensure that cutting price is the last thing we do. We will search for and address all other objections before we agree to discount. Second, we must ensure that such discounts are clearly identified in all written documentation, including contracts in order to remind the client of the true value of our services.</p>

<p><strong>Our expertise is not a commodity</strong></p>

<p>We sell our thinking but we do ourselves a gross disservice in selling it in units of doing: time.  When we employ commodity pricing we invite commodity comparisons, regardless of the value we deliver. If we cannot win while charging more, then we must face the reality that we are selling a commodity.</p>

<p>We must price our upfront work, and thus clearly imply that our pricing for these services has little to do with the hours it takes to deliver them.</p>

<p>This implies the need for our pricing to change as the size of the client changes. The larger client pays more to ensure his commitment to solving his problem because we are delivering a service that has a greater dollar value to him.</p>

<p><strong>We are not a pro-bono organization</strong></p>

<p>We will treat charity as charity and not confuse it with business development. Every one of our for-profit engagements will bring us profit. Our carefully selected pro bono clients will bring us nothing but fulfillment.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lucas Vittor</name><email>lvvittor@gmail.com</email></author><category term="english" /><category term="business" /><category term="entrepreneurship" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is heavily inspired by the Win Without Pitching book.

In this post, I will comment on some main key points about “How Great Founders Do More with Less”. This post is not a review of the book, there are many out there. It’s only a guide to refer to when young founders ask me questions about minimalist entrepreneurship.</p>

<h2 id="we-all-start-from-zero">We all start from zero</h2>

<p>Let me reveal a secret to you. Every big idea started small and every founder starts with nothing and learns as they go. Set aside your concerns about funding and software, and concentrate on your first customers, using your time and expertise to solve real problems for real people.</p>

<p>This is about interests rather than skills. You can learn what you need to know and delegate the rest. Do not obtain permission. Just get started. Most people don’t start. Most people who start don’t continue. Most people who continue give up. Many winners are just the last ones standing. Don’t give up, you only need to be right once.</p>

<h2 id="profitability-vs-growth">Profitability vs Growth</h2>

<h3 id="about-setting-the-right-focus-from-the-start">About setting the right focus from the start</h3>

<p>When building a company, many first-time founders tend to seek external capital as a form to validate their business. Another common trap for first-timers is to focus on growth (as a form of the number of employees, the number of followers on their social media, or scaling by a never-ending external capital injection loop) rather than profitability. That’s basically because there is a misconception that external investment confers validation to do things in expensive ways, but that’s not true. It’s about revenue and traction. Most of all, paying customers is the permission you need to grow.</p>

<p>It’s valid that there are some great businesses that need a lot of up-front cash. However, the vast majority of software startups don’t need to rush to VC money. See it like this; if you raise money now your company has two distinct sets of stakeholders: your investors and your customers. Your customers do not want you to get bigger and grow faster. They do not care which venture capitalists you raised money from, or how many employees you have. They only want your product to improve, and your business to stick around. That’s about it.</p>

<p>When you are profitable, you can take your time. Since you are running on your own steam, your runway will last forever.  You can talk to customers and make sure understand their problems before you attempt to solve them. Then you can iterate on your solution until your customers are happy with it. If you can grow something really substantial with baby steps, you won’t be afraid of taking the longer path. You will not die unless you do something stupid.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-grow-cheap">How to grow cheap</h3>

<p>For now, your goal is to move away from being paid directly for your time. Selling your time does not scale nearly as well as other types of business but can generate positive cash flow much sooner, giving you the breathing room to think about what comes next.</p>

<p>In between moving away from being paid for your time, learn about sales. Learn while doing. Sales is an education process. Sales is aligning your customers’ problems with your company’s needs. Sales is not a four-letter word. Understand that marketing is sales at scale, so you first need to be great at sales, later at marketing.</p>

<p>When you have been solving your customers’ needs for a while, it’s time to create a product that your company will use to scale the business. Now, and only now, you understand what are the market problems, and you have (some) expertise in solving them. This is the correct path. However, many first-time founders just put their heads down and start coding a “solution” for a problem that doesn’t exist. Understand the market problems, solve them pseudo-manually with (probably) broken processes, and create fast-feedback loops to iterate your product.</p>

<p>Here are two good quotes from the book that explains this process of product discovery and fast-feedback loops:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Building a business is a lesson in fast feedback loops and iteration. Imagine if you were on a boat searching for treasure, but you could only ping your radar once a year. Then once a month. Then every day. The boat is your business, and the treasure is product-market fit (repeat customers).</em></p>

  <p>— <cite>Sahil Lavingia</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Creating a product is a process of discovery, not mere implementation. Technology is applied science.</em></p>

  <p>— <cite>Naval Ravikant</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="a-practical-0-day-product-checklist">A practical <strong>0-day product checklist</strong></h4>

<p>The goal here is to build something “good enough”. Good enough to show others, and good enough for them to pay for.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" /><strong>Can I ship it on a weekend?</strong>
  If you can’t ship it fast, you are building a minimum viable product, not a manual valuable process.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" /><strong>Is it solving my customers’ problems?</strong>
  This is easy since your product is created by the accumulative expertise your company has gained in solving real people’s problems.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" /><strong>Is a customer willing to pay me for it?</strong>
 Put profitability in front.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" /><strong>Can I get feedback quickly?</strong>
 Remember the boat-treasure analogy.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" /><strong>Make it easy for customers to pay.</strong>
 When you’re growing, there will always be broken processes. However, be sure your sales process is not stopping your growth.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="customers-were-strangers-before">Customers were strangers before</h4>

<p>Communicate why and how you do what you do. Writing is a long-term game for long-term companies. Most founders are not comfortable putting themselves at the center of their company’s story. But they need to. People don’t care about companies, they care about other people.</p>

<p>How to create a cheap communication channel:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Name your business</li>
  <li>Build a website and create an email address.</li>
  <li>Create social media accounts.</li>
  <li>Build in public.</li>
  <li>Trust the feedback loop.</li>
</ol>

<p>Never forget that while social media is sexy, it is not the be-all of your business. Social media is at the top of the funnel. It’s mostly strangers. That’s why you should start building an email list. It gives you a direct line to your customers that isn’t controlled by a recommendation system, or whether you spend money on advertising. The more targeted you can get, the less you have to spend.</p>

<p>Understand communication funnels. Your audience (network of everyone you can reach when you have something to say) will grow much larger than your customer base—but your customer base is a subset, likely the most passionate, of your audience.  People do not transform from strangers to consumers overnight. They progress from strangers to dimly aware of your presence to gradually becoming fans, and lastly to customers and then repeat customers who help you spread the word.</p>

<h4 id="remember-the-important-thing">Remember the important thing</h4>

<p>Many, many, many, founders do first the “<strong>communication</strong>” before the “<strong>0-day product checklist</strong>”, and they are completely wrong. This is because of two common stupid things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to show off than create real value for real customers. Many “founders” only want other people to see how good they are at “business” but very few care about the one single more important thing: solving real problems.</li>
  <li>Many think they need a landing page or a social media account before their first manual valuable process as a show-off of expertise to target customers. That’s not true. Solve the fucking problem first. Then earn money. Finally, make the things scale.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="find-a-co-founder">Find a co-founder</h2>

<h3 id="why-i-need-a-co-founder">Why I need a co-founder</h3>

<p>The fact that most plane crashes are due to engine failure doesn’t mean planes shouldn’t have engines. All you have to do is look at the empirical evidence. Successful single-founder startups are so rare that they’re famous on that account. If you are a single founder should be aware you are doing something that, for whatever reason, rarely works.</p>

<h3 id="choose-the-right-one-not-the-best-one">Choose the right one, not the “best” one</h3>

<p>Finding a co-founder is important as the first years will be (very) hard. Finding a co-founder is not like dating, but if things do not go so well you probably want a good relationship. No one wants a berk working with them, and neither you. Some important things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t start a relationship with someone unless you really, really trust them.</li>
  <li>Do introduce vesting so that each of you earns your stock over several years.</li>
  <li>Do make sure you are aligned on your values, what you want to build, and how you want to build it.</li>
  <li>Do not ignore the possibility that one of you may leave. Plan for what a successful exit from the business may look like.</li>
  <li>Do have the hard conversations as early as you possibly can. Hard conversations get harder the longer you wait to have them.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-to-ask-the-future-co-founder">What to ask the future co-founder?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What does a happy relationship look like?</li>
  <li>What does success for this business look like?</li>
  <li>What does an exit look like?</li>
  <li>How fast do we want to grow?</li>
  <li>Why are we starting this together?</li>
  <li>Why don’t you start this business with another person?</li>
</ul>

<p>Have these hard conversations again and again (monthly, quarterly and yearly). Think about specific meetings to reevaluate these goals so that disagreements don’t fester silently, and make sure that whatever path you plan on taking, you’re on the same page about it.</p>

<h2 id="hire-big-players">Hire big players</h2>

<p>The further you can get without hiring your first engineer if you are building a software product, the higher your chances of achieving profitability. However, if you already “built” (software is more like a garden rather than a building) one product, now you’re building another: the product is your company, and your customers are your employees. Understand that organizations are people, and building a company full of humans is more rewarding than building software, but it is also much harder.</p>

<h3 id="measure-what-matters-and-have-action-plans">Measure what matters and have action plans</h3>

<p>Whether you have one employee or one hundred, have clear KPIs that everyone knows about and can measure their work against. Articulate your values early and often, because you will need them to avoid veering off course as you grow. Have the hard conversations early, as they’ll only get harder the longer you wait.</p>

<p>Understand the difference between behavior and intention. Behavior is what someone is doing; the intention is why they’re doing it. Most people judge themselves based on their own intentions but then judge others based on their behavior.</p>

<h3 id="make-managing-great-by-ownership-and-autonomy">Make managing great by ownership and autonomy</h3>

<p>The problem with traditional managers is that they aren’t really invested in the success of the people they manage. Managing, it’s about caring your employee’s career aspirations and growth beyond what your company might require. It’s about the long-term game for long-term people.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if you hire well, your employees will be better managers of themselves than you could ever be. And in the long run, giving everyone autonomy allows you to be a peer to your employees so that you can code alongside your engineers, design alongside your designers, and spend your time building rather than constantly managing others.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lucas Vittor</name><email>lvvittor@gmail.com</email></author><category term="english" /><category term="business" /><category term="entrepreneurship" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I read a good book to tackle some questions for the inexperienced founder to build profitability from day one.

<h2 id="103-bits"><a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/">103 bits</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t ever work for someone you don’t want to become.</li>
  <li>When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.</li>
  <li>Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.</li>
  <li>The biggest lie we tell ourselves is “I don’t need to write this down because I will remember it.” <em>(That’s the reason why I write this post)</em></li>
  <li>Speak confidently as if you are right, but listen carefully as if you are wrong.</li>
  <li>Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two.</li>
  <li>Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.</li>
  <li>You cannot get smart people to work extremely hard just for money.</li>
  <li>We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade.</li>
  <li>It’s possible that a not-so-smart person, who can communicate well, can do much better than a super-smart person who can’t communicate well.</li>
  <li>Backups are cheap compared to regrets.</li>
  <li>When you are stuck, explain your problem to others. Often simply laying out a problem will present a solution. Make “explaining the problem” part of your troubleshooting process. <em>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber duck debugging</a> is that you?)</em></li>
  <li>Don’t bother fighting the old; just build the new.</li>
  <li>You are as big as the things that make you angry.</li>
  <li>If you repeated what you did today 365 more times will you be where you want to be next year?</li>
  <li>Copying others is a good way to start. Copying yourself is a disappointing way to end.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="99-bits"><a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/">99 bits</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Under-promise and over-deliver.</li>
  <li>Be governed not by the tyranny of the urgent but by the elevation of the important.</li>
  <li>Don’t create things to make money; make money so you can create things. The reward for good work is more work.</li>
  <li>Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them well enough so they never want to.</li>
  <li>A multitude of bad ideas is necessary for one good idea.</li>
  <li>Most overnight successes —in fact, any significant successes— take at least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly<strong>.</strong></li>
  <li>To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy.</li>
  <li>It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="68-bits"><a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/">68 bits</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different.</li>
  <li>A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.</li>
  <li>Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hang out with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.</li>
  <li>The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.</li>
  <li>Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator’s mind must be unleashed from judgment.</li>
  <li>Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen.</li>
  <li>How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely</li>

<h2 id="the-product">The product</h2>

<p>We set ourselves to create an autonomous data-driven optimization tool for time budgeting management.</p>

<p>The tool (Budgie) starts with a discovery phase of your expectations and needs. Then, as an exploration phase, it analyzes all your time habits and finally, assigns time slots in your calendar optimized for the objective you have set for yourself.</p>

<p>The last stage of followups, asks you if you were able to meet that time slot, to know the progress, and reschedule if necessary. This way, if you consistently fall short of your budget, it helps you rethink it so it’s attainable. Also, we create statistics about your progress in each time frame.</p>

<p>At its core, an optimizer finds the best time slots for you to leverage your time habits to make the most out of your time. A marketplace of connectors helps you to integrate the optimizer with the data sources that work best for you. Do you use Google Calendar? We’ve got you covered. Notion, ClickUp? That’s on the roadmap. Also, you don’t need to download anything: you can use our telegram bot, notion, or whatever you prefer to input your goals.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed the experience. We validate in less than 36hs that there is a real market with users who are willing to pay for Budgie to help meet their personal goals.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you want to know more and/or tell us how you’d use it!</p>

La mayoría de nosotros vamos a pasar más de cinco años acá y cada experiencia es diferente</p>

<p>Ahora tengo hecho más del 50% de Ing. Informática y me estoy adelantando al plan de la carrera, con un promedio por encima de la media.</p>

<p>Mientras iba cursando me fui dando cuenta algunos hábitos que seguían los alumnos con mejores notas y aplicarlos me sirvió para estudiar menos y tener mejor rendimiento.</p>

<p>Esto es lo que yo necesitaba cuando estaba empezando la facultad y hoy se los quiero dejar como un manual para “hackear” al ITBA.</p>

<h2 id="recomendaciones-generales">Recomendaciones generales</h2>

<p><strong>Seguí el plan de la carrera, por algo esta así.</strong></p>

<p>Antes de que empiece el cuatrimestre, investigá cuáles son las materias más difíciles y ordená por nivel de dificultad. Dedicale más tiempo a estudiar las más difíciles: es importante que las guías estén al día.</p>

<p>Priorizá tener todo “aprobado” que muy buenas notas en algunas materias y re-cursar una: a largo plazo no hay diferencia entre un 6 y un 10.</p>

<p><strong>Las materias que estás cursando ya las cursó alguien antes. Buscá esas personas, preguntáles que temas conviene estudiar y cuáles no sirven.</strong></p>

<p>Buscá a alguien que esté un cuatrimestre adelantado (él tiene las cosas más recientes: pedile los TPs y parciales), otro que esté varios años delante (te va a dar recomendaciones sobre electivas, intercambios y profesores) y otro que ya se haya recibido (te va a servir para tener una visión más amplia de que cosas realmente sirven fuera de la facultad).</p>

<p><strong>Buscá las guías resueltas.</strong></p>

<p>Muchos profesores dicen que no las veas, pero la mayoría de la gente con buen promedio las ve. Te sirve para tener el “big picture” y entender cuales cosas sirven para el parcial.</p>

<p>Entendé que la idea idea es hacer las guías rápido para estar al día y poder resolver ejercicios de parciales.</p>

<p><strong>Hay veces que uno cree estar al día pero la realidad es otra.</strong></p>

<p>Conseguí un grupo de +5 amigos que sean más capaces que vos, estudiá con ellos.</p>

<p>Preguntales semanalmente cómo van con las guías y cerca de los exámenes (en general dos semanas antes) hagan parciales juntos.</p>

<p>SIEMPRE es una mala idea estudiar solo.</p>

<p><strong>Intenta tener apuntes compartidos con tus amigos.</strong></p>

<p>Tener un único apunte te va a asegurar dos cosas:</p>

<p>1) Vas a tener la misma base de estudio que tus otros amigos.</p>

<p>2) Vas a tener un apunte más completo porque lo hicieron varias personas.</p>

<p>Estos apuntes siempre complementalos con apuntes de cuatrimestres pasados.</p>

<p>Acordate la regla de oro: SIEMPRE hay uno que ya aprobó la materia que estás cursando, fijate cómo hizo.</p>

<p><strong>Si vivís lejos de la facultad repasá mientras estás en el transporte público.</strong></p>

<p>La idea es re-leer por arriba lo que aprendiste en el día. Hacerlo te va a permitir ver el big-picture de lo que dieron.</p>

<p><strong>Antes de empezar el cuatrimestre buscá los calendarios de las materias y fijate en que días se dan los temas.</strong></p>

<p>Yo los sincronizo con Google Calendar y antes de tener la clase leo los apuntes de cuatrimestres anteriores.</p>

<p>No importa leer al detalle, yo leo los títulos principales de lo que voy a ver. Después en la clase vas a entender mejor por qué parte de los conceptos del día vas y ya vas a estar preparado para lo que den.</p>

<p>Esta técnica sirve mucho si en general te aburrís en las clases: uno nunca sabe cuanto falta para terminar. Con esta nueva forma tenes un “índice mental” que vas tachando a medida que dan los temas.</p>

<p>Una idea para mantener esta lista de recursos es tener esto actualizado es un github pages opensource con todos los links.</p>

So, as a group, it’s important to understand what learning really is.</p>

<p>The best definition I found was from Earl C. Kelley:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“We have not succeeded in answering all our problems. The answers we have found only serve to raise a whole set of new questions. In some ways, we feel we are as confused as ever, but we believe we are confused on a higher level and about more important things.”
— The Workshop Way of Learning (1951)</em></p>

That historical document was originally published in 1944, for use by <strong>OSS</strong> agents in motivating potential foreign saboteurs. The booklet contains instructions for destabilizing progress and productivity by non-violent means. Moreover, is separated into headings that correspond to specific audiences, including: “Organizations and Conferences”, “Managers and Supervisors” and “Employees”.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to extrapolate that manual to the startup environment. You should use this as a tool to detect red flags in your organization and a way to understand how to avoid getting there.</p>

<p>Think about this booklet as the <em>anti-agile</em> startup manifesto.</p>

<h2 id="organizations-and-conferences">Organizations and Conferences</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Insist on doing everything through “channels”. <strong><em>Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to, expedite decisions.</em></strong></li>
  <li>Make “speeches”. <strong><em>Talk as frequently as possible and at great length</em></strong>. <strong><em>Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences</em></strong>. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate “patriotic” comments.</li>
  <li>When possible, refer all matters to committees, for “further study and consideration”. <strong><em>Attempt to make the committees as large as possible - never less than five.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.</em></strong></li>
  <li>Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to reopen the question of the advisability of that decision.</em></strong></li>
  <li>Advocate “caution”. Be “reasonable” and urge your fellow-conferees to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Be worried about the propriety of any decision.</em></strong> Raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="managers-and-supervisors">Managers and Supervisors</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Demand written orders.</li>
  <li><strong><em>“Misunderstand” orders. Ask endless questions or engage in long correspondence about such orders.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Do everything possible to delay the delivery of orders</em></strong>. Even though parts of an order may be ready beforehand, <strong><em>don’t deliver it until it is completely ready.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Don’t order new working materials until your current stocks have been virtually exhausted</em></strong> so that the slightest delay in filling your order will mean a shutdown.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Order high-quality materials which are hard to get.</em></strong> If you don’t get them argue about it. Warn that inferior materials will mean inferior work.</li>
  <li>In making work assignments, <strong><em>always sign out the unimportant jobs first</em></strong>. See that the important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers of poor machines.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products</em></strong>; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw. Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.</li>
  <li>Make mistakes in routing so that parts and materials will be sent to the wrong place in the plant.</li>
  <li><strong><em>When training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.</em></strong> Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Multiply paperwork in plausible ways.</em></strong></li>
  <li>Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, paychecks, and so on. <strong><em>See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Apply all regulations to the last letter.</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="employees">Employees</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Work slowly. <strong><em>Think out ways to increase the number of movements necessary on your job.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>Even if you understand the language <strong><em>pretend to not to understand</em></strong> instructions in a foreign tongue.</li>
  <li>Pretend that instructions are hard to understand, and ask to have them repeated more than once. Or <strong><em>pretend that you are particularly anxious to do your work, and pester the foreman with unnecessary questions.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>Snarl up administration in every possible way</em></strong>. Fill out forms illegible so that they will have to be done over; make mistakes or omit requested information in forms.</li>
  <li>If possible, join or help organize a group for presenting employee problems to the management.</li>
  <li>Misroute materials.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Mix good parts with unusable scrap and rejected parts.</em></strong></li>
